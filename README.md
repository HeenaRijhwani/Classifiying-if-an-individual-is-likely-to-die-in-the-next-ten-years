# Classifiying-if-an-individual-is-likely-to-die-in-the-next-ten-years

The dataset used for the purpose of this project was collected from 1971 to 1982. It is a national health and nutrition examination survey. It consists of various behavioural and clinical attributes for 1629 individuals. Using this dataset, we aim to predict whether an individual is likely to die within the next ten years (yes/no) using data mining techniques.

Techniques used: Logistic Regression, KNearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, Chi Square Test, Recursive Feature Selection, Mutual Information, Forward Selection, Anova f test, Python.
